# Robot-Friend
<b>Explanation of the Above Code:</b>
1) The code defines a class named "Robot" with a constructor (init) that takes a parameter "name" and initializes two attributes: "name" and "is_healthy" (set to True by default).
2) The class has two methods: "get_cold," which sets the robot's health status to False, simulating catching a cold, and "display_health_status," which prints a message indicating whether the robot is in optimal condition or not.
3) An instance of the Robot class is created with the name "RoboFriend" (robot1).
4) The initial health status of the robot is displayed using the "display_health_status" method.
5) The robot's health status is then updated by calling the "get_cold" method, and the updated health status is displayed again. The output would show that "RoboFriend" is initially in optimal condition, but after calling "get_cold," it is under the weather and needs virtual antivirus.
